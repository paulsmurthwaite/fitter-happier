# Project Log

## Purpose
The project log is a useful aid in helping to manage the project. The log includes entries for each week of project-related activity.  It details events or facts that occur in the project, providing more details on the things that are being done.  It contains only historical information; it contains facts about the project but does not include reflection.

It provides:  
- a reminder of how the project develops; this is useful when writing assignments  
- assistance in discussions with the tutor
- a record of how the project was completed, how time was managed, how tasks were tackled, and how problems were dealt with
- assistance in keeping to the schedule, and inform any required changes to the schedule
- a record of how much time was spent on the project
