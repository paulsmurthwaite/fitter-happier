# Procedures

## Purpose
Where the project uses documentation on software installation, configuration steps, or any recurring tasks, these are organised in the /procedures folder for easy reference. Each procedure is organised in its own file (e.g., setup-pfsense.md, install-active-directory.md).  

Each document includes:
- Procedure Name
- Purpose
- Step-by-Step Instructions: anchored headings for each major step make it easier to follow (e.g., ## Step 1: Download Software).
- Common Errors and Fixes: Any issues that might arise with steps and troubleshooting tips.
